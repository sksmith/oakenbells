In early spring of 100 Plankromance was the 10th embarkment of The Oaken Bells as commanded by his lord majesty King Libash Goldroar. This is a recounting of the fall of that failed fortress.

For two years Plankromance grew successfully. It had a solid iron based economy, dozens of happy dwarves and was even beginning to see regular visitors at its esteemed pub. They even successfully set up a system for diverting water from a nearby stream creating a cavern able to grow Plump Helmets with very few casualties!

However, the peace and prosperity ended one evening when a massive lizard walking upward like a dwarf appeared, calling itself Mistir. The creature attacked the first dwarf it came across, a dancer named Urdim Helmlancer. She fought back valiently while the fearsome creature threw her to the ground and bit at her again and again until violently crushing her spine.

The men-at-arms arrived in time to save Urdim, but not before she was wounded beyond the ability to walk. The dwarves managed to get her into a stable status, but she was bedridden after the attack.

A month passed without incident but on the next full moon of early Autum 102, a horror was unleashed upon the unsuspecting members of Plankromance. Urdim, and others that were harmed in the battle a month ago were suddenly transformed into Werelizards! The slaughter was abrupt and terrible. Officials, and workers alike were butchered in the halls. Blood coated nearly every surface.

Few dwarves did survive that horrific night, but the killing blow was already dealt. Plankromance at this point would surely fall.

Still, travelers curious about strange rumors of the goings-on at Plankromance would brave its once illustrious tavern.

But they too, would perish.

So ended the dwarven fortress of Plankromance, left to ruin. Overrun by Werelizards.
